  abstract = {U-statistics are used to estimate a population parameter by averaging a function on a subsample over all the subsamples of the population. In this paper, the population we are interested in is formed by the entries of a row-column exchangeable matrix. We consider U-statistics derived from functions of quadruplets, i.e. submatrices of size 2x2. We prove a weak convergence result for these U-statistics in the general case and we establish a Central Limit Theorem when the matrix is also dissociated. Since row-column exchangeable matrices are an actual representation for exchangeable bipartite networks, we apply these results to statistical inference in network analysis.},

  abstract = {Biomonitoring ecosystems is necessary in order to evaluate risks and to efficiently manage ecosystems and their associated services. Agrosystems are the target of multiple stressors that can affect many species through effects cascading along food webs. However, classic biomonitoring, focused on species diversity or indicator species, might be a poor predictor of the risk of such whole-ecosystem perturbations. Thanks to high-throughput sequencing methods, however, it might be possible to obtain sufficient information about entire ecological communities to infer the functioning of their associated interaction networks, and thus monitor more closely the risk of the collapse of entire food webs due to external stressors. In the course of the 'next-generation biomonitoring' project, we collectively sought to experiment with this idea of inferring ecological networks on the basis of metabarcoding information gathered on different systems. We here give an overview of issues and preliminary results associated with this endeavour and highlight the main difficulties that such next-generation biomonitoring is still facing. Going from sampling protocols up to methods for comparing inferred networks, through biomolecular, bioinformatic, and network inference, we review all steps of the process, with a view towards generality and transferability towards other systems.},

  abstract={The flight deck of commercial aircraft is sophisticated and searching for the necessary information at the right time is sometimes challenging. This research investigates pilot's visual parameters while interacted with two different designs of crew alerting system by eye tracking technology. There are 24 aviation professionals that participated in this experiment including commercial pilots, private pilots and avionic engineers. Compared with traditional design, the new integrated design applied proximity compatibility principles to assist pilots in searching necessary information to deal with urgent situations. The results demonstrated that the integrated design is superior to traditional design in providing accurate instructions as determined by visual behaviors. However, the integrated design increases pilot's situation awareness by redirecting attention from current task to the most critical task with the cost of a longer total fixation duration time. Pilot's visual parameters demonstrated significant differences while interacting with PFD mainly numeric, ND mostly by symbols and EICAS with presented text messages. Therefore, flight deck design has to adopt a holistic approach as pilot's visual attentions is shifting among all types of different displays to gain situation awareness rather than focus on only one display. The design of integrated EICAS can provide detailed instructions to deal with urgent situations which induced higher cognitive loads as pilot's pupil dilation is significant bigger than interacted with traditional design. By eye tracking technology, it is applicable to design human-centred flight decks to improve safety and human performance in aviation.}
