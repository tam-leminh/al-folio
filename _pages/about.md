I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in statistics at Inria Grenoble Rhône-Alpes, working with [Julyan Arbel](https://www.julyanarbel.com/) and [Florence Forbes](https://mistis.inrialpes.fr/~forbes/). 

My scientific interests lie in model-based statistical methods, addressing questions in life sciences. I am particularly interested in nonparametric models with latent variables. My PhD research focused on designing novel statistical tools for analyzing ecological networks.

In November 2023, I have defended my PhD in Applied Mathematics at Université Paris-Saclay under the supervision of [Stéphane Robin](https://scj-robin.github.io/), [Sophie Donnet](https://sophiedonnet.github.io) and [François Massol](https://sites.google.com/a/polytechnique.org/francoismassol/home). 
Before that, I received a Master in Applied Mathematics from Institut Polytechnique de Paris, after completing the joint [Mathematics for Life Sciences](https://sites.google.com/view/m2-msv/accueil?authuser=0) program with Université Paris-Saclay.
In a past life, I studied aeronautics and aviation engineering and worked as a software engineer.
