I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Inria Grenoble Rhône-Alpes, working with [Julyan Arbel](https://www.julyanarbel.com/) and [Florence Forbes](https://mistis.inrialpes.fr/~forbes/). In November 2023, I have defended my PhD in applied mathematics at Université Paris-Saclay under the supervision of [Stéphane Robin](https://scj-robin.github.io/), [Sophie Donnet](https://sophiedonnet.github.io) and [François Massol](https://sites.google.com/a/polytechnique.org/francoismassol/home). 

My scientific interests lie in statistics and applied probability for life science, in particular ecological questions. My PhD research has been aimed at designing novel statistical tools to analyze ecological networks.
